# Peddiehacks-2022-NutriSphere
NutriSphere is an application that helps users maintain a healthy and fit lifestyle through daily meal plan trackers, as well as providing motivation through its unique system: spheres.

"Health & Fitness Simplified". Maintaining physical fitness is something to be proud of - a healthy body is one that seeks to find methods to support oneself and one's family. In order to achieve daily objectives in a balanced manner, a sound and active mind is necessary.

And yet because of the incessant need for commodities and our fast-paced lifestyles, we are always on the go and have little time for self-care. As a result, we present to you a health and fitness-care application that enables users to quickly check on and manage their nutritional status and physical condition.


**Our project consists of a functioning website created using HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery, as well as our full functioning app prototype "NutriSphere", created using the Axure application.**
